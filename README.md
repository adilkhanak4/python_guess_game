<h1>🎯 Python Number Guessing Game</h1>
<p>A simple command-line number guessing game written in Python. The game generates a random number and you have to guess it. Based on how quickly you guess it correctly, the game will evaluate your performance.</p>

<h1>🧠 How It Works</h1>
<ul>
<p>The program uses Python’s built-in random module to generate a secret number.</br>

You have unlimited attempts to guess the correct number.</br>

After each guess, you’ll be told whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.</br></p>

<h3>Once you guess the correct number:</h3>

<li>If you guessed it in 5 or fewer tries → 💡 Brilliant!</li>

<li>If you guessed it in 10 or fewer tries → 🌟 Excellent!</li>

<li>If it took more than 10 tries → 👍 Great!</li></ul>
